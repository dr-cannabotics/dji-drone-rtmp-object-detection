# Real-Time Object Detection and Live Streaming with DJI Mini 3 Pro over RTMP

This project enables real-time object detection on live video streams from a DJI Mini 3 Pro drone, utilizing DJI Goggles 2, an RTMP server, and OpenCV. Designed for applications requiring immediate analysis of aerial footageâ€”such as surveillance and environmental monitoringâ€”the system streams from the DJI Fly app to a Node.js RTMP server, where OpenCV processes each frame for object detection. The setup supports pre-trained models to detect and highlight objects within the video feed in real time.

## Components

- **DJI Mini 3 Pro & DJI Goggles 2**: Capture and display the video feed.
- **Smartphone**: Streams video via the DJI Fly app to an RTMP server.
- **Node.js RTMP Server**: Manages the video stream.
- **OpenCV**: Processes video frames for object detection.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Processes video frames with OpenCV in real time, detecting objects based on COCO classes.
- **Low-Latency Streaming**: Streams live video from the DJI Fly app to a local RTMP server, viewable on VLC or similar clients.
- **Independent Detection Scripts**: `opencv_detection_image.py`, `opencv_detection_video.py`, and `opencv_detection_webcam.py` can run independently for detecting objects in images, video files, or webcam feeds, without requiring the RTMP server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed.
2. **Python 3.x**: Set up Python and install OpenCV for object detection.
3. **DJI Fly App**: Use the DJI Fly app on a smartphone to configure video streaming.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dr-cannabotics/dji-drone-rtmp-object-detection/
   cd dji-drone-rtmp-object-detection
   ```

2. **Set Up RTMP Server**:
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install node-media-server
     ```
   - Start the RTMP server:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```
     The server listens on `rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live`.

3. **Configure DJI Fly App for RTMP Streaming**:
   - Connect DJI Goggles 2 to the drone and smartphone.
   - Configure the stream in DJI Fly app to `rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live`.

4. **Verify RTMP Stream (Optional)**:
   - Open VLC, navigate to **Media > Open Network Stream**.
   - Enter the RTMP URL: `rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live`.
   - Click **Play** to confirm the live video feed is working.

5. **Install OpenCV in Python**:
   - Set up a virtual environment (optional):
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv ~/myenv
     source ~/myenv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install OpenCV:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python
     ```

## Running the Python Detection Scripts

The following scripts are included in the project and can be run independently for different video sources. Only `opencv_detection_rtmp.py` requires the RTMP server; the others do not.

### 1. **Detect Objects in RTMP Stream**

   For detecting objects on a live RTMP stream from the DJI drone:
   ```bash
   python opencv_detection_rtmp.py
   ```
   *Note*: Ensure the DJI Fly app is streaming to `rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live`, as configured above.

### 2. **Detect Objects in an Image**

   For detecting objects in a single image file:
   - Place your target image in the project folder or specify its path in the script.
   - Open `opencv_detection_image.py` and update the image path:
     ```python
     img = cv2.imread('test_image.png')  # Specify the path to your image file
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python opencv_detection_image.py
     ```
   *Note*: This script runs independently and does not require the RTMP server.

### 3. **Detect Objects in a Video File**

   For detecting objects in a video file:
   - Place your target video file in the project folder or specify its path in the script.
   - Open `opencv_detection_video.py` and update the video file path:
     ```python
     cap = cv2.VideoCapture('test_video.mp4')  # Specify the path to your video file
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     python opencv_detection_video.py
     ```
   *Note*: This script runs independently and does not require the RTMP server.

### 4. **Detect Objects via Webcam**

   For real-time object detection using your computerâ€™s webcam:
   ```bash
   python opencv_detection_webcam.py
   ```
   *Note*: This script runs independently and does not require the RTMP server.
